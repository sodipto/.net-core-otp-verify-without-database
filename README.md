# OTP Verify using Cryptography and without any Database

### Dependencies
This verification depends on the [HMCSHA256]. Computes a Hash-based Message Authentication Code (HMAC) by using the SHA256 hash function. See [Details]

### OTP Verification process

- A hash(server end) is created with the phone number and then sent to the user as a OTP token.
- The user received the OTP via SMS.
- The user sends back the OTP token, OTP and phone number used in the first http request.
- The server verify the request and returns the response verified or not.
